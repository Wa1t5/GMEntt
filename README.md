# GMEntt
Game Maker Entity System 

# Why
Well, why not?

# How this works
Instead of using objects for each entity of your game you can just use a script and create a struct object (objects created with the new keyword are turned into structs), and by doing it you can save entire objects using the new game maker save system
Also we do use one object so we can still use GM's collision system
